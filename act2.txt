Suddenly a wrinked face old man appears out of thin air and says:

Old Man: Rita my daughter, I know you do not know me.
I am your late father whom you might have heard so much about
Take the flute, play it when you are sad. It would lighten your 
emotions and countenance and attract good fortunes to you.

Rita so bewildered couldn't find words to reply the old man.
In fear she runs back to her grand mother's house leaving the flute.
