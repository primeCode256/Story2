Rita arrives home, went into her sleeping chambers, and found the 
flute on her mat. She almost shouted. The old man appears again
and whispers into her ears:

Old man: Rita my daughter, I am not here to scare you. I love you
take the flute, play it and watch the furtunes it will bring to you

Rita took the flute, played it and she experienced happiness and bliss
the man disappears into the thin air again.
